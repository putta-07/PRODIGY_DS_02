# Titanic Survival Prediction

This notebook explores the Titanic dataset and builds a model to predict passenger survival.

## Project Overview

The sinking of the Titanic is a well-known historical event. This project aims to analyze the passenger data and identify factors that influenced survival. We'll use various data science techniques to clean, explore, and model the data.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Titanic passenger list, which includes information about each passenger, such as age, gender, class, and whether they survived. It's a popular dataset for introductory data science projects.

## Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning:** We handle missing values and convert categorical features into a suitable format for modeling.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** We use visualizations and summary statistics to gain insights into the data, exploring relationships between different variables and survival.

3. **Feature Engineering:**  We create new features from existing ones to potentially improve model performance. (**Optional, you can add this if you perform feature engineering**)

4. **Model Building:** We train a machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree) to predict passenger survival based on the available features.

5. **Model Evaluation:** We evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Results

The notebook presents the findings of the analysis, including key factors that influenced survival and the performance of the prediction model. (**You can elaborate on specific findings here**)
